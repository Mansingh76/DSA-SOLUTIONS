134. Gas Station (Can Complete Circuit)

Explanation: If total gas >= total cost, thereâ€™s a solution. Reset start whenever tank < 0.


class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int total = 0, tank = 0, start = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < gas.length; i++) {
            int diff = gas[i] - cost[i];
            tank += diff;
            total += diff;
            if (tank < 0) { 
                start = i + 1; // reset starting station
                tank = 0;
            }
        }
        return total >= 0 ? start : -1;
    }
}
